		// 				Previously I worked in the legal industry as a litigation support analyst.  I really enjoyed the logic and database management aspects of my former role.  I wanted to find ways that I could leverage those skills in a career where I could have more room for growth and creativity.  I started looking into programming, which fit the bill and I took the plunge in January and started at Grace Hopper in June. I'm looking for a role where I can be a fullstack developer working with data management and also continue to develop. </p>
